                The Virtual Machine Server Operating System, otherwise known as VMServer OS is the open source operating system that ComputerVM uses in it's servers to operate VMs efficiently.<br>
                This operating system is designed to be lightweight and minimal, yet complete with essential features, with programs like the ComputerVM VM Manager(CVMVMM), the admin panel to manage any of the VMs, VM Web Caster, which is the one that generates a proxy to route the VMs into WebSocket with WebRTC, and many more tools and features.<br>
                VMServer OS is based on Tiny11, and as you might notice, it has the Classic Windows theme, to achieve less RAM and resource usage. We developed this OS on our own after the users (haven't) complained that the old infrastructure we (haven't once) used, the <a href="https://computernewb.com/wiki/CollabVM_Server_1.x_(TypeScript)">CollabVM Server 1.x</a>, didn't have audio, and was (not) slow in older devices.<br>
                VMServer OS is pretty lightweight, only requiring atleast 2 GB to boot and do ordinary things(web browsing, using the tools for other purpose, or running light OSes in the VMs), 10 GB of storage, and CPUs atleast from 2017, for the targeted use, running Windows 11/11 or Linux on the VMs, 4 to 8 GBs of RAM is recommended(4 is the minimum for a decent experience), 40 GB of storage, and finally, a 2019 to 2020 CPU will be a game changer :)<br>
                Compared to other VM Servers, like our competitor's(CollabVM), forks of it, or other servers, VMServer OS is the most comfy choice.<br>
                The ISO is not publicly listed as: We want to polish it, and finally, it doesn't exist, it's a lie.<br>
                Btw, VM Manager, the star program of the show, is based on QEMU, but don't worry, we merged it with VirtualBox's UI, it is ultra easy to make a VM! :)

			<h2 id="history">History</h2>
			<p>
                VMServer OS first started as a terminal OS, and instead of the custom VM Manager, it used a simplified QEMU with simple commands, but it wasn't the friendly, we had, 1 by 1, to carry a Notebook with the commands, it was painful.<br>
                VMServer OS 0.5.2 added finally a Desktop Envoriment, but you still had to use the terminal to install things, the apps weren't properly adapted yet, and you had to login in the shell to access the DE.
                VMServer OS 0.6.21 was when it finally became GUI-focused.<br>
                VMServer OS 0.8.9 was when all the apps, tools, and features were adapted to GUI Interfaces.<br>
                On VMServer OS 0.9.4 Patch 4 was when we finally replaced the simplified QEMU with our fork.
                VMServer OS 0.9.9 Patch 9 was when it finally, it was near completion.
                We currently on VMServer OS 1.2.x, but the UI ended becoming a bit <strong>too</strong> clunky, so we are developing VMServer OS 2.x.

			<h2 id="cani">Can I run normal programs in VMServer OS?</h2>
			<p>
                YES YOU CAN! AS THE WHOLE UNEXISTENT OS IS BASED ON TINY11, WHICH IS BASED IN WINDOWS 11!!! YAY :)))
